What does this bundle do?
-----------------

This bundle was created to provide sprite generation to symfony2 projects. It allows you to dynamically merge images and build SCSS-file for the sake of siplicity.

Only PNG images are supported.

Image directory should be used only for sprites!

Dependencies
-----------------

To merge images the bundle needs Imagick.
